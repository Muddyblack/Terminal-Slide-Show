      # Nginx serves static files, so VITE_BACKEND_URL needs to be baked in at BUILD time usually.
      # However, if your app uses this at runtime, it's fine. 
      # Note: For static builds, env vars usually need to be present during 'npm run build' in the Dockerfile 
      # OR injected via a window object at runtime if you want dynamic configuration.
